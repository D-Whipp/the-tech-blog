## Description

Welcome to The Tech Blog. A CMS-style blog site where we as developers can create posts sharing our thoughts and opinions concerning Technologies. Here you can create an account and make your own posts. You can comment on other user's posts and they can comment on yours.

The Tech Blog exists because it's a full stack application that helps me hone my skills as a developer. It was built using MySQL, Node, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Handlebars, and other technologies.
